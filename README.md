# SocialMedia-Blocker
This little firefox extension should give a notification everytime you access a social media site.
The sites that are currently effected by this extension are:
- youtube.com
- instagram.com

## The extension is now public!
You can check it out here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/social-media-blocker/
The extension is experimental and I'm still working on it ;)
